I thought that this assignment went fairly well. I was glad with how it turned out. I wish that I had used a html preview from the beginning instead of waiting for the page to update every time. Once I got one though, the process went a lot faster. I am proud of getting flexboxes to work because it took me a while and I had to revisit the flexbox section from the readings. The biggest challenge I had was figuring out how to layout everything and make it look good. To overcome this, I installed a html preview in VS code to see what changes I was making in real time. Over all, this was a lot of fun and ran fairly smoothly.
